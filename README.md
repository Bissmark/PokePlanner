# Pokemon Database
## Introduction

I have built a pokemon database for pokemon and moves where you can build your party
up with pokemon from the First Generation and select the moves for them, you select from
a wide array of pokemon with different heights, weights, types and description, then you
can choose what moves you want each pokemon to have.
You have the ability to add to your party or release them, but you can only have a max
party of 6 pokemon
