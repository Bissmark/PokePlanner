# Pokemon Database
## Introduction

I have built a pokemon database for pokemon and moves where you can build your party
up with pokemon from the First Generation and select the moves for them, you select from
a wide array of pokemon with different heights, weights, types and description, then you
can choose what moves you want each pokemon to have.
You have the ability to add to your party or release them, but you can only have a max
party of 6 pokemon

Technologies
============

This project is created in Javascript using the libraries:
- Ruby on Rails 5.2.8.1
- Hover css
- Bcrypt 3.1.7
- CSS and HTML
- SQL
- Heroku

## How to play
#

You just need to load 
https://ceegeherokupokemon.herokuapp.com/
into your web browser to play. From there you can sign up with an email and password, you will be
taken to the party screen where you can look at pokemon and moves, create/delete pokemon, delete
moves or start adding to your fierce party of pokemon.

## Motivation
#

I love pokemon, have done since I played red when I was 6 years old. I have played every iteration
of pokemon for the last 25 years and will do far into the future. The early ones are my favourites
and I wanted to build a database of pokemon that can be used in future projects. I want to build a
pokemon online battler (similar to Pokemon Showdown) and this is that first step towards building
that.

## Credits
#

Joel and Loden have been massive helps with issues around my party view, getting that to work
was a huge positive for me so I say a big shoutout to those 2 because this project would be pretty
mediocre without that done.

## Features
#
Huge list of Pokemon and Moves to choose from, pretty pages for the pokdex theme, ability to
create your own party and what moves they will have.
It has a massive seed file (for what I have done so far) of 555 lines and has 4 working tables
with many to many and many to 1 associations throughout. It was a big endeavour writing out all
the pokemon and moves, but it was very much worth it.
